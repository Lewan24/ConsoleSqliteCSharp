# ConsoleSqliteCSharp
Simple console Todo application to manage tasks in SqLite database.
Included entityframeworkcore

Application was made just for fun to test how does offline database works (SqLite)

Thing that I decided not to do is to implement functionalities of finishing tasks and updating them.
(Just not important for now, needed only basic environment to test database operations)
